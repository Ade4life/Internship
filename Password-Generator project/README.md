The generate_random_password function generates a random password based on the desired length.
The check_password_strength function categorizes the password based on its length.
The main function takes user input for the desired password length, generates a random password, and evaluates its strength.
The generated password, its length, and strength are displayed on the console.
To run this code, copy it into a Python environment and execute it. You'll be prompted to enter the desired password length (within the specified range), and the script will generate a random password and display its length and strength.
